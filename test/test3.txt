Procedural and Declarative Knowledge 

A distinction which is made in Artificial Intelligence is that between procedural and 
declarative types of knowledge. A piece of knowledge is said to be declarative if it is 
stored explicitly, so that not only the programmer but also the program can "read" it as if 
it were in an encyclopedia or an almanac. This usually means that it is encoded locally, 
not spread around. By contrast, procedural knowledge is not encoded as facts-only as 
programs. A programmer may be able to peer in and say, "I see that because of these 
procedures here, the program "knows' how to write English sentences"-but the program 
itself may have no explicit awareness of how it writes those sentences. For instance, its 
vocabulary may include none of the words "English", "sentence", and "write" at all! Thus 
procedural knowledge is usually spread around in pieces, and you can't retrieve it, or 
"key" on it. It is a global consequence of how the program works, not a local detail. In 
other words, a piece of purely procedural knowledge is an epiphenomenon. 

In most people there coexists, along with a powerful procedural representation of 
the grammar of their native language, a weaker declarative representation of it. The two 
may easily be in conflict, so that a native speaker will often instruct a foreigner to say 
things he himself would never say, but which agree with the declarative "book learning" 
he acquired in school sometime. The intuitive or chunked laws of physics and other 
disciplines mentioned earlier fall mainly on the procedural side; the knowledge that an 
octopus has eight tentacles falls mainly on the declarative side. 

In between the declarative and procedural extremes, there are all possible shades. 
Consider the recall of a melody. Is the melody stored in your brain, note by note? Could a 
surgeon extract a winding neural filament from your brain, then stretch it straight, and 
finally proceed to pinpoint along it the successively stored notes, almost as if it were a 
piece of magnetic tape? If so, then melodies are stored declaratively. Or is the recall of a 
melody mediated by the interaction of a large number of symbols, some of which 
represent tonal relationships, others of which represent emotional qualities, others of 
which represent rhythmic devices, and so on? If so, then melodies are stored 
procedurally. In reality, there is probably a mixture of these extremes in the way a 
melody is stored and recalled. 

It is interesting that, in pulling a melody out of memory, most people do not 
discriminate as to key, so that they are as likely to sing "Happy Birthday" in the key of F- 
sharp as in the key of C. This indicates that tone relationships, rather than absolute tones, 
are stored. But there is no reason
